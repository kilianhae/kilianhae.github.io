subtitle: "A new diffusion model for Graphs"
---
Developed a Diffusion Model for Graphs using discrete Bernoulli Perturbations of edge connections.
Over previous Graph Diffusion Models this approach results in maintained sparsity, and sampling with much less steps. \
During the Project I learned PyTorch and Lighnting to build models and slurm for managing training runs and wandb for tracking and analyzing runs.
