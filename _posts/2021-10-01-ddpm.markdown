Diffusion Model for Graphs using discrete Bernoulli Perturbations over edge connections.
This approach results in maintained sparsity, and sampling with much less steps resulting in new SOTA graph generation.\
<!-- Implemented in PyTorchto build models and slurm for managing training runs and wandb for tracking and analyzing runs. -->
