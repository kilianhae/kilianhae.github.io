subtitle: "A new diffusion model for Graphs"
---
Developed a Diffusion Model for Graphs using discrete Bernoulli perturbations.
Learned how to implement more complex models in Pytorch with efficient implementations.
Furthermore I learned how to use a Compute Cluster for managing training runs (we used the SCSC Lugano Cluster) and how to conduct experiments and write a scientific report.
