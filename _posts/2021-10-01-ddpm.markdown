Supervised by [Karolis Martinkus](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/mkarolis){:target="_blank"} and [NathanaÃ«l Perraudin](https://perraudin.info){:target="_blank"} I have implemented a Diffusion Model for graphs using discrete Bernoulli perturbations. We published the paper in a neurips workshop and at the first Learning On Graphs Conference.

During this I have learned about the Diffusion Models, GNNs and on how to implement more complex models in Pytorch with efficient implementations.
Furthermore I learned how to use a Compute Cluster for managing training runs (we used the SCSC Lugano Cluster) and how to conduct experiments and write a scientific report.
