Together with my friend [Lukas Limacher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaslimacher/){:target="_blank"} I started an IoT company specializing in models for predicting meeting room occupancy.\
In the founding year I specialized in product development and prototyping and build our MVP. In the later stages as my interests grew more technical alongside my studies I switched to a Junior Data Science role working with the amazing [Vassilis Kalofolias](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bz1RQ8MAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.\
We sold the company in 2022 to Logitech, where I stayed on for 4 additional months before leaving to take as many courses as possible.
