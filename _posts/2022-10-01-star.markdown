A neural representation model for predicting the temporal evolution of a phase boundary generated during 3D-printing.\
We use a direct star-convex parameterization of the phase boundary vs learning the underlying temperature field. The parameterization at a single time is learned by a Graph Neural Network and over time as an RNN.
