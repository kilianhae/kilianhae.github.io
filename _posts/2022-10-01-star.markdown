A neural representation model for predicting the temporal evolution of a phase boundary generated during 3D-printing.\
We use a direct star-convex parameterization of the phase boundary vs learning the underlying temperature field. The parameterization at a single time is learned by a Graph Neural Network and over time as an RNN.

I expanded my capabilities in writing and organizing a large scale project with different datasources, different models, and different Datasets and Dataloaders. I did this by using Hydra for config management and Lightning to organize my torch modules. -->
