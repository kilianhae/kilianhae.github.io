Supervised by [Karolis Martinkus](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/mkarolis){:target="_blank"} and [NathanaÃ«l Perraudin](https://perraudin.info){:target="_blank"} I developed a application specific model for predicting the temporal evolution of a phase boundary generated during 3D-printing.

This project was a good exercise into how one can design application specific models which require very little compute by leveraging properties of the problem itself. Here we used the star-convexity of the shapes in order to reduce our model size to a fraction. Further, by using the assumption on the smoothness of the underlying heat equation we used Graph Neural Network to get state of the art results with a tiny model.
