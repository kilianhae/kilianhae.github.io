Together with my friend Lukas Limacher I started an IoT company specializing in models for predicting meeting room occupancy. There I specialized in various different tasks from starting doing mainly product development and prototyping to in the later stages switching to a Data Science role as my interests grew more technical alongside my studies. We sold the company in 2022 to Logitech.
