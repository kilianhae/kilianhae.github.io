Together with my friend [Lukas Limacher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaslimacher/){:target="_blank"}  and [Vassilis Kalofolias](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bz1RQ8MAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, I started an IoT company specializing in models for predicting meeting room occupancy.\
The company was acquired by Logitech in 2022.
